## Sensorimotor Loops
These are basic control loop go from input (echo) to motor output or abstraction output

### 1. Avoid:
- linear velocity defined by distance to onset
- angular velocity is steering away from the objects with a magnitude to be a function of onset distance

### 2. Approach:
- using IID to steer toward object.
- linear velocity is defined by distance to onset
